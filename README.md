Currently a project going on three years, with the end goal of producing studio quality midi files from wav files. 
Current pipeline is as follows Stem Seperate the Sound -> Get Key -> Get BPM -> Align Beat Grid -> Frequency Detection -> Onset Detection -> Write to MIDI.
This is a simplified pipeline and currently no machine learning is used, which will have to change, especially for polyphonic onset detection.
